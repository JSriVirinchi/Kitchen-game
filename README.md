# Kitchen-game
This is a third person game built using unity game engine
Player Controls:

Implement a third-person camera.
Control player movement with WASD keys.
Allow the player to jump with the spacebar.
Ensure the camera rotates to follow behind the player.
Environment Design:

Create two medium-sized rooms linked by a single short hallway.
Design the rooms to be more than just boxes. Add items and platforms for the player to interact with.
Make the rooms distinct in terms of contents and appearance. Feel free to use shapes other than squares.
Constantly Moving Objects:

Include at least five constantly moving objects in either room.
Objects can move within a room or travel between rooms.
Ensure their position/rotation updates every frame.
Define a maximum value for object translation to keep them within the game space.
Objects can rotate in place or translate along at least one axis.
Texturing:

Apply textures to every object in the game.
Avoid using the default white color for any object.
You are free to find or create your own textures to use in the project.
